<!-- JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. -->

<!-- All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names 

The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

Variables defined with CONST behave like LET variables, except they cannot be reassigned:-->

    <script>
    
                  // variable var:  var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.
      // It is globally scoped when a var variable is declared outside a function. 
      //This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block
      // is available for use in the whole window.
      
      //globally scoped 
      var greeter = "hey hi";

      //function scoped
      function newFunction() {
          var hello = "hello";
      }

      console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined (function scoped)
      console.log(greeter); // allowed: because greeter is globaly scoped.

      //We'll get an error which is as a result of hello not being available outside the function.
      //var variables can be re-declared and updated.




                  // Variable let: a let variable cannot be re-declared within its scope.
    // When using let , you don't have to bother if you have used a name for a variable
    // before as a variable exists only within its scope.
    { 
    let a = 2;

    console.log(a)
    console.dir(a)
    // this will work (block scoped)
    }

    console.log(a)
    console.dir(a)
    //this will not work (outside block)
    

                 // variable const
    //Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. 

    //const declarations share some similarities with let declarations:

    //1. const declarations are block scoped.
    //Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block it was declared.


    //2. const cannot be updated or re-declared
    //This means that the value of a variable declared with const remains the same within its
    // scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared. 
    const flow = {
        message : "say Hi",
        times : 4
    }

    //we cant do this: 
    const greeting = {
        words : "Hello",
        number : "five"
    }//error :  Assignment to constant variable.

    //but we can do this: 
    greeting.message = "say Hello instead";

    <h1>Resume var let cons</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped
      while let and const are block scoped.
      </li>

      <li>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope;
      let variables can be updated but not re-declared;
      const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</li>

      <li>They are all hoisted to the top of their scope
      but while varvariables are initialized with undefined,
      let and const variables are not initialized.</li>

      <li>While var and let can be declared without being initialized,
      const must be initialized during declaration.</li>

    <!-- Data Types-->
    <script>
      //There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /,
      // addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
      
    // ****** A number: ******
    let n = 123;
    n = 12.345;

    alert( "not a number" / 2 );
    // NaN, such division is erroneous
    // NaN = Not a Number

    // ****** A String: ******
    // A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes!
    let str = "Hello";
    let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
    let phrase = `can embed ${str}`;


    //Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s no difference between them in JavaScript.

    //Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…},
    //for example:

    let name = "John";

    // embed a variable
    alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!

    // embed an expression
    alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3



    // ****** A boolean (logical type): ******
    //The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

    let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked
    let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked


    //Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:

    let isGreater = 4 > 1;
    alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")

      //The “OR” operator is represented with two vertical line symbols: ||
      result = a || b;
      //In classical programming, the logical OR is meant to manipulate boolean values only.
      // If any of its arguments are true, it returns true, otherwise it returns false.


      // ****** Arrays: ******
      // JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. Example:
      var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

      //Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:
      var cars = [
      "Saab",
      "Volvo",
      "BMW"
    ];

                 //Access the Elements of an Array:
      //You access an array element by referring to the index number.

      //This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:
      var name = cars[0];

      //example: 
      var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];

      //Note: Array indexes start with 0.
      //[0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.

                  //Changing an Array Element:
      //This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:
      cars[0] = "Opel";

      //example:
      var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
      cars[0] = "Opel";
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars[0];
